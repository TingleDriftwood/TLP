	I have all of the components.
		I have stolen the hops from Prew. Hopefully, he will never find out it was me that tipped his poor cow, Betsy.
		With the help of the bartender, Dwayne Rockbeard, I was able to get Jimmy drunk enough to give me some of his barley.
		I have the pure water from Antonica.
		I have the pure water from the Commonlands.
		I have the pure water from Nektulos Forest.
		I have the pure water from the Thundering Steppes.
