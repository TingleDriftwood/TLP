## Tingle's Vanguard Log Parser

Tingle's Vanguard Log Parser is a small project to improve my Java skills.

In earlier versions for Everquest II i made the mistake to start too early
with the GUI and did too less basic working on the parse functionality. So
I started this new project complete from the scratch.

All kinds of help are welcome. even if you only tell me that this piece of
code is crap (but please tell it me polite).

Not quite sure how successful this attempt will be, because there is plenty
of other stuff which I should do in my free time.

Kind regards
